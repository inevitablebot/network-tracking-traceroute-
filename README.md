 NetRack Automation Tool (netrack.exe)



NetRack is a command-line automation tool designed to enhance and simplify the functionality of the `tracert` (Trace Route) command in a Windows environment. This tool serves as an efficient solution for network diagnostics, allowing users to automate traceroutes and customize the process based on specific requirements. NetRack streamlines the analysis of network paths, identifies potential issues, and aids in monitoring connectivity to specified destinations.

Key Features:

1. User-Friendly Input:
   - NetRack prompts users to input the target IP address they wish to trace.

2. Option Selection:
   - Users can choose from various options to customize the traceroute:
     - `-d`: Do not resolve addresses to hostnames.
     - `-h`: Set the maximum number of hops to search for the target.
     - `-j`: Use a loose source route along a host-list (IPv4-only).
     - `-4`: Force using IPv4.
     - `-6`: Force using IPv6.
     - `a`: Default option (no additional arguments).

3. Automated Tracerouting:
   - Based on the selected options, NetRack automatically generates the appropriate `tracert` command and executes it.

4. Customization:
   - For the `-h` and `-j` options, users can input additional parameters such as the maximum number of hops or a list of intermediate hosts.

5. Error Handling:
   - NetRack captures the result of the `tracert` command and provides a simple error indicator. A return value of 0 indicates success, while 1 indicates an issue during the traceroute.

6. User Interaction:
   - After completing the traceroute, the tool prompts users to press any key to exit, providing a user-friendly way to review the results.

Use Cases:

- Network Troubleshooting:
  - NetRack is an essential tool for diagnosing network connectivity issues, helping users identify the path taken by data packets and potential points of failure.

- Performance Monitoring:
  - Network administrators can use NetRack to monitor network performance, analyze latency, and detect bottlenecks.

- Security Analysis:
  - By visualizing the network route, users can assess the security of the data path and identify unexpected or suspicious hops.

Notes:

- The tool offers flexibility for both casual users who prefer default settings (`a` option) and advanced users who need specific traceroute configurations.
